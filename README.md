*Project completed for the 2023 Institute for Data Science and Big Data, American University*

This project investigates the spread and impact of COVID-19 among populations in DC, Maryland, and Virginia. But more specifically, it focuses on looking directly at how COVID-19 intersects with different social, economic, and health determinants that impact the American population. As to be noted in the subsequent sections, the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the United States has, and is, well documented but there is a local lens that is missing from the analysis of its true impacts, hence the goal of this project.

Our data sources were the United States Census Bureau and COVID ActNow.

Our file structure is as follows:
- `data and cleaning` contains an .Rmd file which imports the data via API and cleans it. The final dataset is then exported to a .csv file. 
- `analysis` contains our final report and .bib file.
- `visualizations` is a folder for any exported graphs and tables.
- `code` provides all the code to conduct our statistical analysis.
