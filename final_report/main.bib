	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review provides a critical assessment of recent pediatric population health research with a specific focus on child health equity. The review addresses: the role of the healthcare sector in addressing fundamental social drivers of health, challenges within healthcare organizations in addressing health-related social needs and the social determinants of health, and the rationale for incorporating race and racism in pediatric population health research and practice. RECENT FINDINGS: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic brought greater attention to the disparities and inequities in American health and healthcare. In response to these stark inequities, many health systems are adopting efforts and initiatives to address social needs, social determinants of health, racism, and health equity. However, empirical evaluation detailing the effectiveness of these interventions and initiatives is limited. SUMMARY: While attention to identifying social needs among pediatric populations is increasing, there is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of these interventions in producing sustained reductions in health disparities. To advance child health equity, researchers should move beyond individual behavior modification and directly examine fundamental drivers of health inequities. These drivers include government and health policies as well as societal forces such as systemic racism. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: The impact of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the US has been hampered by a substantial geographical heterogeneity of the vaccination coverage. Several studies have proposed vaccination hesitancy as a key driver of the vaccination uptake disparities. However, the impact of other important structural determinants such as local disparities in healthcare capacity is virtually unknown. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we conducted causal inference and geospatial analyses to assess the impact of healthcare capacity on the vaccination coverage disparity in the US. We evaluated the causal relationship between the healthcare system capacity of 2417 US counties and their COVID-19 vaccination rate. We also conducted geospatial analyses using spatial scan statistics to identify areas with low vaccination rates. Findings: We found a causal effect of the constraints in the healthcare capacity of a county and its low-vaccination uptake. Counties with higher constraints in their healthcare capacity were more probable to have COVID-19 vaccination rates ≤50, with 35\% higher constraints in low-vaccinated areas (vaccination rates ≤ 50) compared to high-vaccinated areas (vaccination rates {\textgreater} 50). We also found that COVID-19 vaccination in the US exhibits a distinct spatial structure with defined “vaccination coldspots”. Interpretation: We found that the healthcare capacity of a county is an important determinant of low vaccine uptake. Our study highlights that even in high-income nations, internal disparities in healthcare capacity play an important role in the health outcomes of the nation. Therefore, strengthening the funding and infrastructure of the healthcare system, particularly in rural underserved areas, should be intensified to help vulnerable communities.

Objectives: We describe the effect of job-related, sociodemographic, and other exposures on the incidence, relative risks and PAFs of severe COVID-19 in individuals aged 18–64. Methods: We conducted a registry-based study in Swedish citizens aged 18–64 from 1 January 2020 to 1 February 2021 with respect to COVID-19-related hospitalizations and death. Results: Of 6,205,459 persons, 272,043 (7.5\%) were registered as infected, 3399 (0.05\%) needed intensive care, and 620 (0.01\%) died, with an estimated case fatality rate of 0.06\% over the last 4-month period when testing was adequate. Non-Nordic origin was associated with a RR for need of intensive care of 3·13, 95\%CI 2·91–3·36, and a PAF of 32·2\% after adjustment for age, sex, work, region and comorbidities. In a second model with occupation as main exposure, and adjusted for age, sex, region, comorbidities and origin, essential workers had an RR of 1·51, 95\%CI, 1·35–1·6, blue-collar workers 1·18, 95\%CI 1·06–1·31, school staff 1·21, 95\%CI 1·01–1·46, and health and social care workers 1·89, 95\%CI 1·67–2·135) compared with people able to work from home, with altogether about 13\% of the PAF associated with these occupations. Essential workers and blue-collar workers, but no other job categories had higher risk of death, adjusted RRs of 1·79, 95\%CI 1·34–2·38 and 1·37, 95\%CI 1·04–1·81, with adjusted PAFs of altogether 9\%. Conclusion: Among people of working age in Sweden, overall mortality and case fatality were low.

	abstract = {Background Concern remains about how occupational SARS-CoV-2 risk has evolved during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to ascertain occupations with the greatest risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore how relative differences varied over the pandemic. Methods Analysis of cohort data from the UK Office of National Statistics COVID-19 Infection Survey from April 2020 to November 2021. This survey is designed to be representative of the UK population and uses regular PCR testing. Cox and multilevel logistic regression were used to compare SARS-CoV-2 infection between occupational/sector groups, overall and by four time periods with interactions, adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, region, household size, urban/rural neighbourhood and current health conditions. Results Based on 3 910 311 observations (visits) from 312 304 working age adults, elevated risks of infection can be seen overall for social care (HR 1.14; 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.24), education (HR 1.31; 95\% CI 1.23 to 1.39), bus and coach drivers (1.43; 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.97) and police and protective services (HR 1.45; 95\% CI 1.29 to 1.62) when compared with non-essential workers. By time period, relative differences were more pronounced early in the pandemic. For healthcare elevated odds in the early waves switched to a reduction in the later stages. Education saw raises after the initial lockdown and this has persisted. Adjustment for covariates made very little difference to effect estimates. Conclusions Elevated risks among healthcare workers have diminished over time but education workers have had persistently higher risks. Long-term mitigation measures in certain workplaces may be warranted. © 2022 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {We overcome a lack of frontline worker status information in most COVID-19 data repositories to document the extent to which occupation has contributed to COVID-19 disparities in the United States. Using national data from over a million U.S. respondents to a Facebook-Carnegie Mellon University survey administered from September 2020 to March 2021, we estimated the likelihoods of frontline workers, compared to non-frontline workers, 1) to ever test positive for SARs-Cov-2 and 2) to test positive for SARs-Cov-2 within the past two weeks. Net of other covariates including education level, county-level political environment, and rural residence, both healthcare and non-healthcare frontline workers had higher odds of having ever tested positive for SARs-Cov-2 across the study time period. Similarly, non-healthcare frontline workers were more likely to test positive in the previous 14 days. Conversely, healthcare frontline workers were less likely to have recently tested positive. Our findings suggest that occupational exposure has played an independent role in the uneven spread of the virus. In particular, non-healthcare frontline workers have experienced sustained higher risk of testing positive for SARs-Cov-2 compared to non-frontline workers. Alongside more worker protections, future COVID-19 and other highly infectious disease response strategies must be augmented by a more robust recognition of the role that structural factors, such as the highly stratified U.S. occupational landscape, have played in the uneven toll of the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021},

Black, Latinx, and American Indian persons have been hospitalized and died at a higher rate than White persons consistently from the start of the pandemic. Early data show that hospitalization and mortality rates for Black, Latinx, and American Indian children are higher than White children in a worrying trend. The pandemic has likely worsened the gaps in wealth, employment, housing, and access to health care: the social determinants of health that caused the disparities in the first place. School closures will have a long-lasting impact on the widening achievement gaps between Black and Latinx students and White students. In the earlier vaccination phase, Black and Latinx persons were being vaccinated at a lower rate than their proportion of cases due to vaccine hesitancy, misinformation, and barriers to access. Vaccine hesitancy rates among these groups have since decreased and are now comparable to White persons. Aggregated data make it challenging to paint a picture of the actual impact of COVID-19 on Asian Americans as they are a diverse group with significant disparities.

              Eliminating disparities in the burden of COVID-19 requires equitable access to control measures across socio-economic groups. Limited research on socio-economic differences in mobility hampers our ability to understand whether inequalities in social distancing are occurring during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
            
            
              Objective
              We aimed to assess how mobility patterns have varied across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify associations with socioeconomic factors of populations.
            
            
              Methods
              We used anonymized mobility data from tens of millions of devices to measure the speed and depth of social distancing at the county level in the United States between February and May 2020, the period during which social distancing was widespread in this country. Using linear mixed models, we assessed the associations between social distancing and socioeconomic variables, including the proportion of people in the population below the poverty level, the proportion of Black people, the proportion of essential workers, and the population density.
            
            
              Results
              We found that the speed, depth, and duration of social distancing in the United States are heterogeneous. We particularly show that social distancing is slower and less intense in counties with higher proportions of people below the poverty level and essential workers; in contrast, we show that social distancing is intensely adopted in counties with higher population densities and larger Black populations.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Socioeconomic inequalities appear to be associated with the levels of adoption of social distancing, potentially resulting in wide-ranging differences in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in communities across the United States. These inequalities are likely to amplify existing health disparities and must be addressed to ensure the success of ongoing pandemic mitigation efforts.},
